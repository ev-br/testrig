=======
testrig
=======

Python package integration testing.

Runs the test suite of some package against 'old' and 'new' versions
of given dependencies. Failures that appear in 'new' are reported.

Each test suite run is run in a virtualenv constructed from scratch.
You should install ``ccache`` (and possibly also ``f90cache``) to
avoid drinking too much coffee.

Alternatively, binary conda packages can be used --- however, binary
incompatibities may arise in this configuration.

Currently, this is POSIX-only, and tested only on Linux.

See `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/pv/testrig/>`__ for most recent results
for latest Numpy maintenance branch.  Log in to Travis and press the restart
button to re-run the checks for the latest commit / tag.

Usage
-----

Run::

    python run.py --help
    python run.py pandas                            # run tests, default config
    python run.py --config=testrig-conda.ini pandas # use conda packages
    python run.py -j                                # run all packages parallel

The runs may take a long time, as it builds everything from source.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is read from ``testrig.ini`` by default.  It contains
sections, one per test environment.  Section named ``DEFAULT`` can be
used to specify (overridable) default values for the configuration
items.

An example first (runs scipy test suite against old and new numpy
versions)::

  [DEFAULT]
  old=numpy==1.7.2
  new=Cython==0.22 git+https://github.com/numpy/numpy@master

  [scipy]
  base=nose tempita Cython==0.22 scipy==0.17.0
  run=python -c 'import numpy; numpy.test("fast", verbose=2)'
  parser=nose

The configuration items in each section are:

* ``env``: which environment to use

  - ``virtualenv``: virtualenv + pip, all packages are built from sources
  - ``conda``: conda, uses binary packages, except for ``git+`` urls
    and package names prefixed by ``pip+``.
    Note that you may need to write stuff like
    ``numpy git+https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git`` since conda only
    understand that packages installed by it are present.

* ``old``: package specifications for the 'old' configuration.
* ``new``: package specifications for the 'new' configuration.
* ``base``: packages for both configurations. These are installed
  after those specified by ``old`` or ``new``.
* ``run``: command that runs the tests.
* ``parser``: parser for the test output. Available options:

  - ``nose``: parses nose stdout
  - ``pytest-log``: parses contents from ``py.test --result-log=pytest.log ...``
